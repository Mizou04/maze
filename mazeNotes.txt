----------***** MAZE GAME *****--------

REQUIREMENTS :

1/ 2d game based on canvas

2/ it should have walls shaped as a maze

3/ the user/player should be able to move character
   to achieve its goal to gain score

4/ scores should be kept stored 

5/ timer, (modes: not necessary now)

THE PROBLEM:

- a game based on canvas should have a player
  character and a goal character which should get 
  to to win the game.

- each character have his own characteristics and position
  in the canvas

- we need an interface between both the user and 
  canvas to be able to move the character 

- we should track the player, walls and goal
  coordinates to be able to take action based on
  the condition. : <collision> 

THE SOLUTION :

- because we have different units of data (objects)
  that are different from each other we will be 
  using OOP approach to try to solve this problem.
  and it is simple to implement and work with.
  
- each object has an inner state and various methods
  to update this state.

- we need an interface (usually a controller 
  object) to take the PLAYER inputs/events
  handler, and invoke them to call the game actions
  and calculate other datas basing on those actions
 
SYSTEM DESIGN :
---principle modules---
- Player (character)
- Goal
- Walls
- Score
- Canvas
- Game (the container module)
- controller ---> Higher Order function
- Timer

------IPO-----

I) user inputs (key codes)

P) use the keys to move the character 

O) game state : "won" or "lost"


-----STEPS-----

- draw classes diagram
- know relationships and associations between classes
- create classes one by one (start with what u know)
- create UI
- create middleware (controller)
- connect the dots

I will create the whole the simplest way possible
 : - walls, player, goal, movements, collision
